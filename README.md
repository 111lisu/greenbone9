# OpenVAS / Greenbone 9 on Ubuntu Bionic and Virtualbox

Greenbone Security Assistant, a graphical interface that allows you to manage vulnerability scans from a web application

This is my first commit - I'm beginner

Virtualbox and Vagrant applications required.
I had a problem with the device list on LXC
That's why I chose vagrant and VirtualBox

## Install
- apt install vagrant virtualbox-dkms
- vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers
- vagrant up

## Uninstall
- vagrant destroy -f
